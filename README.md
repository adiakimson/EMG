# Short description
This code provides configuration for STM32F042K6T6 Nucleo board that reads 3-channel ADC,
configured with DMA, stores the data and then sends them via either serial port or Bluetooth.
# Further development
It is strongly recommend to switch from a Nucleo 32 to a Nucleo 64 board. This solution provides
only basic aplication of an EMG device.
